Method that Symbol has, but String does not:
  #id2name: this method returns the name or string corresponding to the
            symbol object that this method is called on

Method that String has but Symbol does not:
  #chr: this method returns a one-character string at the beginning of the 
        string

Array method #concat:
  The concat method takes as an argument some other array object and returns
  an array object. It is used to append the elements of the argument array
  to the original array that the concat method is called upon.
  An example would be if you had two arrays that with information that you
  needed to combine and the order of these elements is not, at present, of 
  much importance.
